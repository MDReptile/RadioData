# RadioData - AFSK Data Transfer Application

## Overview

RadioData is a WPF application for transmitting text messages and files over audio using Audio Frequency Shift Keying (AFSK) modulation. It works with computer speakers/microphones, virtual audio cables, or radio transceivers via audio interfaces.

**Current Version**: .NET 8.0  
**Status**: Working with known asymmetry issues in send/receive reliability

---

## 🔍 Code Analysis & Known Issues

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. **Zero-Crossing Detection Asymmetry**
**Location**: `AfskModem.cs` - `ProcessZeroCrossing()` method  
**Problem**: The fixed threshold of **14 samples** for distinguishing Mark (1200 Hz) from Space (2200 Hz) frequencies is hardcoded:

```csharp
if (_samplesSinceCrossing > 14)
{
    _currentLevel = true; // Mark
}
else
{
    _currentLevel = false; // Space
}
```

**Why This Causes Send/Receive Asymmetry**:
- At 44.1 kHz sample rate with 250 baud:
  - **Mark (1200 Hz)**: ~36.75 samples per cycle
  - **Space (2200 Hz)**: ~20.05 samples per cycle
- The threshold of 14 samples is trying to find the midpoint (~18.4 samples)
- However, this threshold is sensitive to:
  - Signal strength (weak signals may have slower zero crossings)
  - Noise levels (can cause premature crossings)
  - Audio device latency differences (input vs output)
  - System audio processing (one device may have more filtering than another)

**Impact**: One computer's audio output may produce slightly different zero-crossing timing than another computer's input captures, causing one direction to work better.

#### 2. **Start Bit Latency Compensation Hardcoded**
**Location**: `AfskModem.cs` - `ProcessUartState()` method  
**Problem**: 
```csharp
case UartState.StartBit:
    if (!_currentLevel) // Detected Space (Start Bit)
    {
        _state = UartState.StartBit;
        _samplesInCurrentState = -2; // ⚠️ Hardcoded compensation
    }
```

**Why This Causes Issues**:
- The `-2` sample compensation assumes a fixed detection delay
- Different audio hardware has different latencies
- This value works well in one direction but may be off in the reverse direction
- Leads to bit timing misalignment and higher error rates in one direction

#### 3. **Baud Rate Mismatch in Documentation**
**Location**: Multiple files  
**Problem**: Code uses **250 baud** but documentation and comments reference **500 baud**
```csharp
private const int BaudRate = 250; // Code says 250
// But README.md and comments reference 500 baud
```
**Impact**: Confusing for developers and users trying to calculate transmission times.

#### 4. **Output Device Index Bug**
**Location**: `MainViewModel.cs` - `OnSelectedOutputDeviceIndexChanged()`  
**Problem**: When loopback mode is enabled at index 0, the device index calculation for real devices is:
```csharp
int deviceIndex = _audioService.IsLoopbackMode ? 0 : SelectedOutputDeviceIndex - 1;
```

However, the loopback check happens in TWO places (input and output selection), and either one can set `IsLoopbackMode = true`, causing confusion when only one is set to loopback while the other isn't.

**Impact**: Can lead to transmitting to wrong device or device index errors.

#### 5. **Signal Clipping with Input Gain**
**Location**: `AfskModem.cs` - `Demodulate()` method  
**Problem**:
```csharp
sample *= InputGain;
sample = Math.Clamp(sample, -1.0f, 1.0f);
```

While clamping prevents overflow, it causes **hard clipping distortion** which destroys zero-crossing timing accuracy.

**Impact**: High input gain can actually make reception worse by distorting the waveform.

#### 6. **Inconsistent Preamble Duration**
**Location**: `MainViewModel.cs` - `SendFile()` method  
**Problem**: Text messages use **1200ms preamble**, but file headers also use **1200ms**. The modulator defaults to **1200ms**.

```csharp
// Text message (implicit 1200ms preamble)
byte[] audioSamples = _modem.Modulate(packet);

// File transmission (explicit 1200ms first packet, 0ms others)
var audio = _modem.Modulate(packets[i], preamble, preambleDuration);
```

**Why This Matters**: 
- 1200ms may be too long for some VOX radios (wastes bandwidth)
- May be too short for others (VOX doesn't trigger reliably)
- No ability to adjust per-device or per-transmission type

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### `AfskModem.cs` - AFSK Modulator/Demodulator
**Modulation**:
- **Baud Rate**: 250 baud (4ms per bit)
- **Mark Frequency**: 1200 Hz (binary 1)
- **Space Frequency**: 2200 Hz (binary 0)
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz
- **Amplitude**: 25% of maximum (optimized for radio VOX triggering)

**Demodulation**:
- **Method**: Zero-crossing detection (counts time between sign changes)
- **UART State Machine**: Idle → StartBit → 8 DataBits (LSB first) → StopBit
- **Squelch Threshold**: 0.01 RMS (1% of max signal)
- **Input Gain**: Configurable multiplier (default 1.0x)

**Known Limitations**:
- Fixed zero-crossing threshold may not work equally well on all hardware
- No adaptive gain control (AGC)
- No Forward Error Correction (FEC)
- Sensitive to background noise

#### `CustomProtocol.cs` - Packet Framing
**Packet Structure**:
```
[Sync Word: 0xAA 0x55] [Length: 1 byte] [Type: 1 byte] [Payload: encrypted] [Checksum: 1 byte]
```

**Encryption**:
- **Method**: XOR cipher with user-provided key (default: "RADIO")
- **Security**: **NOT cryptographically secure** - basic obfuscation only
- **Key Length**: 1-64 ASCII characters

**Packet Types**:
- `0x01` - Text message
- `0x02` - File header (filename + size)
- `0x03` - File chunk (sequence ID + 200 bytes data)

**Checksum**: Simple sum of Type + Encrypted Payload bytes

#### `AudioService.cs` - NAudio Interface
**Transmission**:
- Uses `BufferedWaveProvider` for gap-free multi-packet queueing
- 10-minute buffer capacity for large file transfers
- Background thread monitors buffer and fires completion event

**Reception**:
- Continuous audio capture via `WaveInEvent`
- Mono, 44.1 kHz
- Passes raw audio bytes to demodulator

**Loopback Mode**:
- Software-only mode for testing (no actual audio hardware)
- Audio bytes immediately routed from modulator to demodulator

#### `FileTransferService.cs` - File Chunking & Reassembly
**Chunking**:
- Maximum chunk size: **200 bytes** (payload only, not including protocol overhead)
- Sequence IDs allow out-of-order reception and duplicate detection
- First packet is always file header with metadata

**Reassembly**:
- Fixed-size buffer allocated based on file size from header
- Uses HashSet to track received unique chunk IDs
- No retransmission mechanism (fire-and-forget protocol)

**Timeout Detection**:
- **Silence timeout**: 10 seconds with no packets received
- **Max time timeout**: Calculated as `chunks * 2.5 seconds + 10 seconds buffer`
- Timer checks every 2 seconds

**Image Compression**:
- `.cimg` files are automatically decompressed on reception
- 12-bit color format (4 bits per channel, 2 pixels per 3 bytes)
- ~50% size reduction for images

#### `ImageCompressionService.cs` - 12-bit Color Compression
**Algorithm**:
```
RGB888 (24-bit) → RGB444 (12-bit)
Input:  [R8][G8][B8] [R8][G8][B8] (6 bytes for 2 pixels)
Output: [R4G4][B4R4][G4B4]       (3 bytes for 2 pixels)
```

**Quality Loss**: Each color channel reduced from 256 values to 16 values  
**Use Case**: Faster transmission of images where quality loss is acceptable

#### `MainViewModel.cs` - MVVM Coordinator
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Device selection and audio routing
- Real-time input/output frequency and volume meters
- Encryption key management and persistence
- File transfer progress tracking
- Transmission state management (prevents simultaneous send/receive)

**Device Selection Logic**:
```
Index 0: Loopback (software mode)
Index 1+: Real hardware devices (index - 1 = actual device number)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- **Windows 10/11** (WPF application)
- **.NET 8.0 Runtime** (or SDK for development)
- **Audio Hardware**:
  - Built-in mic/speakers (for testing)
  - Virtual Audio Cable (recommended for loopback testing)
  - APRS-K2 or similar cable (for radio connection)

### Basic Operation

1. **Select Audio Devices**:
   - Choose **Input Device** (microphone/radio input)
   - Choose **Output Device** (speakers/radio output)
   - For software testing, select "Loopback" for both

2. **Set Encryption Key**:
   - Both sender and receiver **must use the same key**
   - Default: "RADIO"
   - Key is saved automatically in `%LocalAppData%\RadioData\RadioData.settings.json`

3. **Transmit Text**:
   - Type message (max 120 characters)
   - Click **Send text**
   - Monitor output meters for frequency (should show 1200-2200 Hz)

4. **Transmit File**:
   - Click **Send file** and select file
   - Check **Compress images** for .jpg/.png files (optional)
   - App shows progress and estimated time
   - Large files: confirm transmission time estimate

5. **Receive**:
   - App automatically listens on selected input device
   - Received text appears in System Log
   - Received files saved to `ReceivedFiles` folder
   - Click **Open Received Files** to view folder

### Radio Setup (Baofeng UV-5R + APRS-K2 Cable)

1. **Connect Hardware**:
   - Plug APRS-K2 cable into radio and computer audio jack
   - Set computer output device to "APRS-K2" or similar
   - Set computer input device to "APRS-K2" or similar

2. **Configure Radio**:
   - **Mode**: FM
   - **VOX**: ON (medium sensitivity recommended)
   - **Frequency**: Same on both radios (simplex)
   - **Squelch**: Medium (too high blocks signals, too low allows noise)

3. **Test VOX Triggering**:
   - Send a test message
   - Radio PTT light should activate when transmission starts
   - Adjust VOX sensitivity if it doesn't trigger or triggers too easily

4. **Optimize Audio Levels**:
   - Start with ~50% computer output volume
   - Receiving radio should show activity but not distort
   - Too loud = clipping/distortion
   - Too quiet = fails to decode

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Loopback Tests (Automated)
**Location**: `RadioDataApp/Tests/LoopbackTest.cs`

Runs automatically in DEBUG mode when app launches. Tests:
1. ✅ Text message encode → modulate → demodulate → decode
2. ✅ Small file transfer (multi-packet)
3. ✅ Encryption/decryption with multiple keys
4. ✅ Multiple sequential messages (state machine validation)

**View Results**: Debug Output window in Visual Studio (`Ctrl+Alt+O`, select "Debug")

### Audio Loopback Test (Manual)
**Location**: `RadioDataApp/Tests/AudioLoopbackTest.cs`

Tests the **full audio pipeline** including NAudio drivers:
- Encodes test message
- Plays through selected output device
- Captures from selected input device
- Demodulates and validates

**How to Run**: Click "Test Audio Loopback" button in UI (requires UI binding)

**Recommended Setup**: Use virtual audio cable (VB-Audio Cable) for reliable testing without acoustic feedback.

### Expected Results
**Memory Loopback**: Should always pass 100% (tests protocol/modem logic only)  
**Audio Loopback**: 
- Virtual cable: ~99% success rate
- Physical speakers/mic: 80-90% (depends on environment)
- Radio loopback: Variable (depends on signal quality)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Symptom: One Direction Works, Other Doesn't

**Root Cause**: This is the main known issue - asymmetric demodulation reliability.

**Why It Happens**:
1. Different audio devices have different characteristics:
   - Output device may have different filtering than input device
   - One device may have more latency than the other
   - Signal strength asymmetry (one radio louder than the other)

2. Zero-crossing threshold is fixed and may favor one device's signal characteristics

3. Start bit detection timing compensation is hardcoded

**Workarounds**:
- **Try adjusting InputGain** slider (but don't go above 2.0x)
- **Swap radio positions** (transmitter becomes receiver)
- **Adjust audio levels**:
  - Reduce volume if signal is too loud (clipping)
  - Increase volume if signal is too weak (below squelch)
- **Test with virtual audio cable first** to isolate hardware vs software issues
- **Use same audio interface model on both sides** if possible

### Symptom: No Reception at All

**Check List**:
1. ✅ Both sides using **same encryption key**
2. ✅ Input device actually selected (not still on Loopback)
3. ✅ Volume levels 50-80%
4. ✅ Radio VOX enabled (for radio use)
5. ✅ Radio on correct frequency
6. ✅ Check System Log for RMS levels - should see `[RMS: 0.0100]` or higher when signal present

**Debug Steps**:
```
1. Enable Debug Output window (View → Output → Debug)
2. Send test message
3. Look for:
   - [RMS: x.xxxx] - Signal is being received
   - Raw bytes (hex values) - Demodulator is working
   - "Checksum Mismatch" - Wrong key or signal corruption
```

### Symptom: Garbled/Corrupted Messages

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Wrong encryption key** - Most common cause
2. **Volume too high** - Causing clipping distortion
3. **Too much background noise** - Adjust squelch or move away from noise sources
4. **Multipath interference** - Try different location (radio only)
5. **Input gain too high** - Reduce from default 1.0x

**Fix**:
- Verify encryption keys match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Reduce volume to 50-60% and test again
- Check output meters - frequency should stay between 1000-2500 Hz
- Look for RMS levels - should be 0.01 to 0.5 (not near 1.0 which means clipping)

### Symptom: File Transfer Timeout

**Normal**: Files transfer at ~250 baud = ~31 bytes/second (including overhead)

**Timeout Triggers**:
1. **Silence timeout**: No packets for 10 seconds (radio link lost)
2. **Max time timeout**: Transfer takes longer than `packets * 2.5s + 10s`

**If Transfer Times Out**:
- Check `ReceivedFiles` folder - partial file may exist with some chunks
- Resend entire file (no resume functionality)
- Consider compressing images first (50% faster)
- For very large files (>10 KB), use direct cable connection instead of radio

### Symptom: Device Index Error

**Error**: "Device index X out of range"

**Cause**: Loopback mode flag set incorrectly due to device selection order

**Fix**:
1. Restart application
2. Select **both** input and output devices (not just one)
3. If using hardware, select index 1 or higher (index 0 is loopback)
4. Verify status message shows correct device name

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Transmission Speed
- **Baud Rate**: 250 baud
- **Bit Duration**: 4 ms/bit
- **Byte Duration**: 40 ms (1 start + 8 data + 1 stop bit)
- **Protocol Overhead**: 
  - Sync: 2 bytes
  - Header: 2 bytes (length + type)
  - Checksum: 1 byte

- First packet: 1200ms preamble + ~600ms data = ~1.8s
- Other packets: ~600ms each × 5 = 3.0s
- **Total**: ~4.8 seconds

For a **10 KB file**:
- Chunks: 50
- Packets: 51
- First packet: ~1.8s
- Other packets: ~30s
- **Total**: ~32 seconds

### Bandwidth Efficiency

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Encryption: XOR Cipher

**How It Works**:
```
Encrypted[i] = Payload[i] XOR Key[i % KeyLength]
```

**Strength**: **VERY WEAK** - not cryptographically secure

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Known-plaintext attack (if attacker knows one message, can derive key)
- Frequency analysis (repeated patterns reveal key length)
- No authentication (attacker can modify messages)
- No key exchange protocol (key must be shared out-of-band)

**Recommendation**: 
- Use for **casual privacy only** (prevents accidental eavesdropping)
- For sensitive data:
  - Encrypt file BEFORE transmission (AES, GPG, etc.)
  - Use licensed/private frequencies
  - Implement proper cryptography (future enhancement)

### Privacy Best Practices
1. ✅ Use unique, long keys (max 64 characters)
2. ✅ Change keys periodically
3. ✅ Use licensed frequencies for sensitive communications
4. ✅ Encrypt files separately before transmission for important data
5. ❌ Do not use default "RADIO" key for anything sensitive
6. ❌ Do not transmit passwords or credentials over this system
