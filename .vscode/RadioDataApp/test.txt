RadioData File Transfer Test

This is a test file for the RadioData application's file transfer capability.

The application uses a custom AFSK (Audio Frequency Shift Keying) protocol running at 420 baud to transmit data over radio frequencies. This novel implementation features:

1. Custom packet framing with sync words
2. XOR obfuscation for security
3. Packet type identification (Text, FileHeader, FileChunk)
4. Checksums for data integrity

This text file demonstrates the ability to transmit structured data beyond simple text messages. The file is split into chunks and reassembled on the receiving end.

Testing successful transmission!
